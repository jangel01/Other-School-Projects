# Default Grammar Parser

This program has a working lexical analyzer, but no parser.

## Your Task

Implement a bottom up parser. The table generated in assignment 1 will be the parse table you use. You can use any language you want, but you will have to provide equivalent functionality of the files provided here. 

## Running the program

You must have a recent version of Python3 installed.

```
python3 main.py
```
