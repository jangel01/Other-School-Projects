# MiniC Parser

This is a program that parses MiniC programs.

## Your Task

Copy your parser implementation from assignment 2 into this directory. Do not rewrite the parser; all that needs to change are the tables. Using the parser generator program, write a grammar for recognizing MiniC programs. Examples of valid MiniC programs are shown in example(1-5).c while two invalid program examples are given in example(6-7).c. Your program should show the the first five elements of the stack and input along with the current action to perform from the parse table at each step.
